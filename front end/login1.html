        <p><b>User management</b> describes the ability for administrators to<em><b> manage user access to various IT
                    resources</em></b>
            like
            systems,
            devices, applications, storage systems, networks, SaaS services, and more. <b> User management is a core
                part to
                any identity
                and access management (IAM) solution, </b>in particular directory services tools. Controlling and
            managing user
            access to IT
            resources is a fundamental security essential for any organization. User management enables admins to
            control user access
            and on-board and off-board users to and from IT resources. Subsequently a directory service will then
            authenticate, authorize,
            and audit user access to IT resources based on what the IT admin had dictated.

            Traditionally, user management and authentication services have been grounded with Windows-based on-prem
            servers, databases,
            and closed virtual private networks (VPN) through an on-prem identity provider (IdP) such as Microsoft
            Active Directory.
            However, recent trends are seeing a shift towards cloud-based identity and access management (IAM), granting
            administrators
            even greater control over digital assets. These solutions enable user management over web applications,
            cloud infrastructure,
            non-Windows devices, and more leveraging modern protocols such as SAML JIT and SCIM (among others).</p>

                <h1>User Management and the Internet Have Coexisted From The Beginning</h1>
            </b>
            Developers have always recognized the need for user access management since the initial development of digital
            networks.
            Prior to the public internet, networks of computers were connected solely on a proprietary basis and largely
            between universities.
            As you may imagine, IT admins and developers did not want unauthorized parties to have access to proprietary
            digital assets. Rather, they wanted to limit access to only those approved for use.
            Thus, user management was born.
    
            As the TCP/IP networks and subsequently the internet began to mature, this notion of limiting access persisted
            and was the primary driving force behind various authentication protocols like LDAP and RADIUS. Microsoft took
            it a step further when they created Active Directory (AD), a product designed to compile user data and provision
            access to various Windows-based IT resources based on need. In a Windows dominated ecosystem, AD remained the
            primary user management, authentication, and authorization platform for d
